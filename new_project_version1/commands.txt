##### What our user should do to run our pipeline !
#######" Clone the repository of the project

git clone https://......................
cd name_repo

#######" create a new environment base on our snakemake.yml file

conda env create --file envs/snakemake_env.yml

########" activate the new environment that have been created

conda activate snakemake_env

########### First DRY-RUN pipeline to make sure everything is working just fine

snakemake -pj10 --use-conda output/result.csv -np

-np is for :
    --dry-run, --dryrun, -n
                            Do not execute anything, and display what would be
                            done. If you have a very large workflow, use --dry-run
                            --quiet to just print a summary of the DAG of jobs.
                            (default: False)
    
    
    --printshellcmds, -p  Print out the shell commands that will be executed.
                        (default: False)
